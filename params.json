This drum sequence is sent by TTL level midi commands to a dreamblaster S1 module. The S1 is a low power waveblaster compatible module, it normally uses 5V but can be powered with 9V just as well. If the cycle period grows longer than 5 seconds, the sequence is stopped. As soon as a new period is detected the sequence is started and/or the tempo is adjusted.
